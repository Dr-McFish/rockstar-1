(Calculate approximate value of pi with the Leibniz series.)
(This series is simple to implement, but converges very slowly.)
( pi/4 = 1 - 1/3 + 1/5 - 1/7 + 1/9 ... )

Put 0 minus 1 into X
Put 1 into N
Put 1 into D
Put 0 into S
Put 100000 into I

While I is greater than 0
Put N over D into Q
Put S plus Q into S
Put X times N into N
Build D up
Build D up
Knock I down

Put 4 times S into Pi
Say Pi
