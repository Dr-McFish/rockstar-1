(Calculate approximate value of pi with the Leibniz series.)
(This series is simple to implement, but converges very slowly.)
( pi/4 = 1 - 1/3 + 1/5 - 1/7 + 1/9 ... )

Put 1 into One
Put One into N
Put One into D
Put nothing into S
Put 1000 into I

While I is greater than 0
Put N over D into Q
Put S plus Q into S
Build D up
Build D up
Put N over D into Q
Put S minus Q into S
Build D up
Build D up
Knock I down

Four is four
Put Four times S into Pi
Say Pi
